## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m Bhavish and I love computers.  
Someday, I’ll showcase my cool projects here and maybe even some mistakes I’ve made along the way.

- 🌱 Currently learning the basics of **C++**, hoping to master it one day  
- 💾 I use **Git** and **GitHub** to save my work  
- 💻 I try my best not to break my laptop every other day  
- 🛠️ If something doesn’t work, assume it’s a **FEATURE**  

I’ll keep adding new stuff as I learn and improve. Check back later — who knows what I’ll create (or mess up) next!
